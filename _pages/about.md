I am a Labor Economist. My research interests include Economics of the Household, especially regarding same-sex couples, as well as Household Finance, and the Economics of Crime.

I'm currently a Research Economist in the [Consumer Research](https://fdic.gov/consumerresearch) section of the FDIC and an Adjunct Professor at Fordham University. 

I received my PhD in Economics from UC San Diego in 2023 and a BSc in Mathematics and in Economics from Fordham University.
