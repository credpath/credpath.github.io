I am Doctoral Candidate in the Economics Department at the University of California, San Diego. My research is in Applied Economics and Labor Economics and my particular interests are in the economics of marriage, couple formation, crime and policing, and health. I will be on the job market in Fall 2022/Spring 2023.
