I am an applied economist and PhD Candidate at UC San Diego. I use modern econometric methods to answer policy-relevant, thought-provoking questions. My research to date studies focuses on the economics of couple formation and marriage, and the economics of crime and policing. My primary fields of interest are Labor Ecoomics and Law & Economics. My secondary fields are Health, Education, Public Economics, and Political Economy.
