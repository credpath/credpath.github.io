I am a PhD Candidate at UC San Diego. My current research focuses on the economics of couple formation and marriage, and the economics of crime and policing. 
My primary fields of interest are Labor Ecoomics and Law & Economics. My secondary fields are Health Economics, Economics of Education, Public Economics, and Political Economy. 

I am currently on the 2022-2023 job market. [Click here to see my job market paper.](https://credpath.github.io/files/Redpath_Job_Market_Paper.pdf)
